    <h2>
      After befriending an attractive person (who is usually foreign) online, he
      or she tells a tale about falling into trouble or hard times. The scammer
      persists with the story to gain their victim's trust and adoration, then
      asks for money as proof of love. Once the money is transferred, the
      scammer disappears. What You Should Look Out For: <br />- Professes their
      undying love very quickly after making contact with you <br />- Goes to
      great lengths to gain your interest and trust with loving words and even
      offers to send you gifts <br />- Gives excuses whenever you ask for a
      video call What You Should Do: <br />- Do not send money to anyone you
      have not met in person <br />- Verify the identity of the person you are
      talking to with an online image search, here: https://images.google.com/
      <br />- Always ask for a LIVE video call with the person It’s not wrong to
      chat with strangers online. But in today’s overly-connected digital world,
      you have to take what people say online with a grain of salt. And don’t
      perform any money transaction to people that you don’t know personally.
      Use the REPORT button on social media when you see any suspicious
      behaviour online. This will notify the website admin of the scammer’s
      profile. Then, use the BLOCK button so the scammers won’t be able to
      contact you ever again. If you find yourself caught in a love scam, tell
      your family and make a police report.
