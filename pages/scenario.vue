      Social Media Impersonation Scams Scammers would usually ask the victims
      for their cpersonal details such as their mobile number, Internet banking
      account details and One-Time Password (OTP) on the pretext of helping them
      to sign up for fake contests or promotions allegedly organised by Lazada,
      Shopee and Qoo10. Victims would later discover that fraudulent
      transactions had been made from their bank accounts and mobile wallets
      without their consent. Never share your Internet banking account details
      and OTPs with anybody â€“ legitimate contests or promotions will never ask
      for such details. Your OTP is like your ATM pin, do not reveal it to
      anyone.
